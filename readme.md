The goal of this project is to explain and show data with a nice visualization.

The input is a file with tab-delimited values (TSV). (the file is supposed to not be in use by other programs)

The input file should follow a certain template:
    - The first column should contain the title of each element (column) (e.g. company name).
    - The second column should contain values on which the height of the column depends (e.g. number of employees).
    - The third column contains the relative path to a PNG image (e.g. the company logo)
    - The fourth column should contain more information about the object (e.g. the country where the company exists) 
The output is an mp4 video
